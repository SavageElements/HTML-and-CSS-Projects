            <h4>The "Left" Bank</h4>
                <p>
                   The “Left” bank of Bordeaux refers to the peninsula to the west of the Gironde River in the eastern wine growing region of Bordeaux, France. The region is primarily known for bold and complex Cabernet Sauvignon dominant wines that age well. Some premire regions of the Left bank include: Medoc, Saint Julien, and Margaux among others.

            <h4> The "Right" Bank</h4>
                <p>
                    The “Right” bank of Bordeaux refers to the rolling farmlands to the east of the Gironde River in the eastern wine growing region of Bordeaux, France. The region is primarily known for Soft and subtly complex Merlot and  Cabernet Franc dominant wines that are smooth early yet still age incredibly well. Some premire regions of the Left bank include: Saint Emillion, Canon-Fronsac, and Pomerol  among others.
                </p>
        
        <h6>Yet despite these differences...</h6>    
        <h1>THERE IS NO "WRONG" BANK</h1>
                <p>
                    Even though each of the above regions can produce exceptional wines, it is not a guarantee that just because a wine comes from Bordeaux, that it will be exceptional. Yet within this region are some of the most most exceptional producers of red blends on the planet, both for wines for drinking now as well as those that could stand a long while in the cellar.

                        It is well to remember that there are five reasons for drinking: the arrival of a friend, one's present or future thirst, the excellence of the wine, or any other reason.
